To test this locally, the following need to be installed:
     * nodeJS: http://nodejs.org/
     * mongoDB: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
     * npm: http://npmjs.org/
     * node-mongodb-native: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native
     * GraphicsMagick

For nodeJS debugging, use node-inspector: https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector

To add more paths open app.js and edit it accordingly. To add the logic for each path, edit index.js in routes.



There is also a script available for redeployment:
redeploy is a shell script to redeploy the sync-service application to the test server.

To use, set an environment variable named PEEK in your .profile (or similar).
This environment variable should be set to the location on your local drive of the
folder containing both the devsync01.pem permissions file and the sync-service folder.

For example:
export PEEK=/Users/jake/workspace/Peek

Then run ./redeploy to transfer and start the current local version of sync-service
on the test server.

If redeploy is in a location somewhere in your PATH, it can be run globally by simply
calling redeploy.
